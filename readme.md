### Welcome to our GitHub Repository

Mark of the Afflicted is a fairly simple addon for Elder Scrolls Online which tracks all of your vampire and werewolf characters and monitors their bite timers. In addition, it provides a handy map system for locating vampire altars and werewolf shrines.

Right now, Mark of the Afflicted doesn't do that terribly much, but I want to take it a lot farther. But, to do that, I need feedback! What can be improved with the existing setup? What would you like to see added? Let me know, and I'll see what I can do!
